Project Outline:
Utilize Kaggle dataset to train a machine learning model to classify tweets based on a sentiment (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
    Call ChatGPT API to identify keywords - incorporate wordcloud
    Dummy encode keywords
    Use train/test split to identify sentiment
    Targeting above 80% accuracy
    
Create visualization of dataset for better understanding

Create User Interface for submission of a tweet
Model will then output the sentiment and keywords based on the training data and ChatGPT API call
